    This script performs two simple print operations to display text messages to the console. The first print statement outputs the word "test" and the second outputs an educational message about the DE loop, explaining that it is a component of Photosystem II (PSII) and plays an important role in respiration. The script contains only basic string output functionality with no data processing, calculations, or complex methods involved.
