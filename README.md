I need to analyze the chloroplast genomes available online. 

I want to assess quality through evaluation of sequence. 

I'll start with Length and GC, then - I think - taxonomy not to be silly. 

Then I think - and this will be the bioinfun part - I'll need to find the inverted repeats. 

Ideally minimal reference bias.
