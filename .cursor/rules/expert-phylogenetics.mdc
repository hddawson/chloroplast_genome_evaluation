# Expert: Phylogenetics

When reviewing `notes_on/`, `lab_notebook.md`, or manuscript-related content:

- **Phylogenetic CV**: Hold out entire clades (not individual tips) to test generalization across phylogenetic distance. Within-clade correlation reduces structure confounding.
- **Clade selection**: Non-overlapping clades, size range 10–50 tips, ~15% holdout. Shuffle candidate order to avoid bias.
- **Tree-aware metrics**: Global correlation can be inflated by structure; within-clade Spearman is conservative.
- **Population structure**: Related taxa share phenotype and genotype; phylo holdout separates causal signal from structure.
