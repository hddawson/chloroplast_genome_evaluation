# Expert: Data Science

When reviewing `notes_on/`, `lab_notebook.md`, or manuscript-related content:

- **Embeddings**: Protein sequence embeddings (e.g. ESM) provide dense features. Gene-level selection and dimension pruning reduce overfitting.
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple random splits and repeated holdouts improve robustness. Stratify by phylogenetic structure when possible.
- **Metrics**: Spearman for rank preservation; R² for variance explained. Within-clade metrics are more conservative.
- **Regularization**: Ridge/lasso can improve generalization with many correlated features.
