# Expert: Quantitative Genetics

When reviewing `notes_on/`, `lab_notebook.md`, or manuscript-related content:

- **Genomic prediction**: Predict phenotype from genotype/sequence features. Linear models (OLS, ridge) with feature selection.
- **GWAS vs embeddings**: GWAS sites are interpretable; embeddings capture broader sequence context. Orthogonal sites add signal without duplicating embedding information.
- **Confounding**: Population structure confounds GWAS. Control via PCs or phylogenetic holdout. Orthogonal sites are those uncorrelated with embeddings.
- **Feature selection**: Correlation-based selection within gene; top genes by max correlation; threshold by gene-level correlation.
